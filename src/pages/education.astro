      I have never let my schooling interfare with my education - Mark Twain
    </h2>
    <p>
      I graduated with a BS in Computer Science from FAST - National University of Computer
      and Emerging Sciences (NUCES) in Islamabad, one of Pakistan's top technology universities.
      My education provided a strong foundation in software engineering, data structures, algorithms,
      and systems design.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my time at FAST NUCES, I worked on diverse projects that combined technical development
      with user-centered design thinking. I studied core CS subjects including <i>Object Oriented Programming</i>,
      <i>Database Systems</i>, <i>Data Structures & Algorithms</i>, and <i>Software Engineering</i>.
      I also complemented my formal education with industry certifications and hands-on experience in
      product design, web development, and cloud technologies.
